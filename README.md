# personal-assistant

The personal assistant project is a project where the agent explains about me. The purpose of this project is to create a simple agent that is capable of defining who you are (it could be a company, a person, or a document) to the user. This app was created using Langgraph, Streamlit, and a custom-built MCP server that connects to the PGVector database.

Note: This version is using MCP stdio. I'm also not publishing this app in streamlit.io
